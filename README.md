## Plan of Action
### Company Summary:

Winpea is a company that has both its market in the scope of Physical Shopping and Digital Shopping within an E-Commerce store. The brand itself was made to connect with many cultures around the globe and touch the hearts of many with radiant & original designs based on accessories such as Bags, Bracelets, Neckalces & many more. The site itself will offer a blog showing off newest fashion trends, a place to book a visit to the store if the customer prefers to see the product & 24/7 customer support with a contact page.

The target audience in summary is those who either have a keen interest in collecting items of luxury/grand design or those looking to purchase gifts for loved ones on special occasions. The aim of the site is to provide solutions that benefit every demographic and attract the most customer traffic both in person and online. The site will prove to be user-friendly, initiuitive as well as visually pleasing to the user.

To summarise, Winpea aims to become to be a one-stop shop for those looking to visit an up-and-coming Jewellery/Fashion brand (either in-person or online) in order to purchase goods for themselves or loved ones.

### Market Analysis:

The High-street Fashion industry is a very competitive one and as such there is a large market and consumer base to consider. Winpea aims to get ahead of the market trends by offering both the ability to visit the store to make purchases or do so online if that is more convenient to the user. To emphasise how convenient the site will be, there is no need to call up the store to make a booking and it can all be done with the booking system in place on the site.

When considering competition, there are many high-value luxury brands that exist in a similar context to Winpea and the way in which we aim to be a cut above the rest is to appeal to as many demographics (within our target market scope of those interested in the products) as possible with our price ranging for the products on the store being very generous. This is so as to not gatekeep the range from Winpea and give everyone a chance to experience the products.

### Marketing and Sales Strategy:

Winpea has many different avenues in places in order to market the brand and company, these involve:

Online Advertising on social media outlets such as Facebook & Instagram
Steady content stream on the site with our blog/newsletter
Partnerships and pop-up events in order to boost public relations

The majority of sales will be made through online sales of the products but a cut will also be made through in person purchases at the Winpea store location.

### Operations and Management:

Winpea is a company that is operated by a team of around 10 people currently, this team is comprised of: CEO, Co-Brand Owner, Website Engineer, Store Manager & Store Assistants.

The store will be run both in person with Store Assistants being able to assist customers in person and also as an online store, with the website being able to process transactions for purchases on products and to then have a 3rd party company be used for distribution of the product to their delivery destination.

#### Financial Plan:

Winpea will generate revenue through the sale of products in our ecommerce shop and the sales of we make in-store in-person. In terms of expenses, the main cost will be marketing and advertising efforts to drive traffic to the website and attract customers. We will also incur expenses related to the development.

In terms of financing, Winpea will initially be funded through a combination of personal investment and sponsorships. As the business grows, we will explore additional funding options such as venture capital.

In terms of projections, we anticipate that there will be a steady increase in profit in the first two years of the company and then a large increase come the third year of running.

### Conclusion:

Winpea is a unique and innovative platform that aims to branch out to customers of jewellery and fashion goods, whilst also offering an easy to use platform for booking a visit in-person to purchase products. Winpea has astounding potential within the market scope and we believe with the plan in place there will be great success within this industry for the company.

## Design

### Colors
The color I chose was black/white to match with the Winpea logo and brand style. I've applied colour to areas I wanted to bring attention to such as the Meet team section

### Fonts

 The font selected was Oswald from Google Fonts with a fallback of sans-serif

# Structure

The site was designed for the user to be familiar with the layout such as a navigation bar along the top of the pages and a hamburger menu button for smaller screen.

The footer contains all relevant social media links that the business has so the user can visit any social media site and follow the business there to expand the businesses followers, likes and shares.
It contains an email sign up form and useful links as well as contact information.

## Website pages

- The site consists of the following pages:
  - Home

## AWS 

I am using AWS S3 buckets to store my data. S3 is a highly scalable and durable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows me to easily store and retrieve large amounts of data, and its built-in security features provide added protection for my files. I chose S3 for its scalability, durability, and security features.

## Database

I built my database using PostgreSQL. It's a powerful and open-source object-relational database system that is known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. I chose it because it provides a flexible tool for efficiently managing and organizing my data.
